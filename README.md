# Facial-Emotion-recognition
Facial expression defines the person as a whole. Thus, there is emphasis on Facial Emotion Recognition system. Through this project we reviewed different CNN model on a FER2013 dataset through Transfer Learning and tried to come to a conclusion regarding the development of Facial Emotion Recognition System. We increased the accuracy from 0.25 to best of 0.642.
